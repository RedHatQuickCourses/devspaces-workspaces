# Devfile Registry

A `Devfile Registry` is a central repository or catalog that stores a collection of predefined `Devfiles`. These devfiles can be used by developers to quickly create and configure consistent development environments for various applications, frameworks, and programming languages.

The registry is often hosted as a service, which can be publicly accessible (https://registry.devfile.io/) or private (self-hosted). The registry server provides access to the available devfiles and facilitates their discovery and retrieval.

An example of a widely used devfile registry is https://registry.devfile.io. It offers a variety of predefined devfiles for languages like Python, Java, Node.js, Quarkus, and more.

A number of sample Devfiles for Dev Spaces are available at https://github.com/devspaces-samples. You can explore and customize these samples to your needs.

NOTE: Dev Spaces deploys its own internal registry that contains the Devfiles for the "getting started sample" applications. Adding your own devfiles to the internal registry is covered in the xref:workspaces:custom.adoc[Customizing Samples in the Dashboard] section.

NOTE: You can create and run your own customized devfile registry outside the cluster. The process to do so is outside the scope of this course. Consult the README file at https://github.com/devfile/registry for details.

== Lab: Creating a Workspace from the Community Devfile Registry

In this hands-on lab, you will browse the public community Devfile catalog and create a workspace from it.

. Using a browser, navigate to https://devfile.io. Search for a `Spring Boot` application. For example, one of the results is `Spring Boot using Java` at https://registry.devfile.io/viewer/devfiles/community/java-springboot. Open this item.

. Click on `Raw devfile` in the right sidebar (below `Resources`). Copy the resulting URL. It defines a devfile for a basic Spring Boot application.

. Log in to the Dev Spaces dashboard as `user1`.

. Paste the URL for the Spring Boot devfile URL in the `Git repo URL` field and click `Create & Open` to launch a new workspace.

. Wait for a few minutes while the workspace is created.

. Once the workspace loads, you should see the source code the application in the left sidebar. Open the task menu by clicking `Terminal > Run Task...`.

. Click `All Tasks` in the dialog to view all the tasks defined in the devfile.

. Run the `devfile:run` task. This will launch a terminal and compile the application code, followed by starting the Spring Boot application. It may take a few minutes to download the dependencies of the application. When it finishes, you should see a prompt in the lower right corner asking you to allow traffic into port `8080`. Click `Yes` , followed by `Open in New Tab` for port `8080` to view the application output.

. Press `Ctrl + C` to stop the application and return to the terminal.
